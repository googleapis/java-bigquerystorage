/**
 * Service Description: BigQuery Read API.
 *
 * <p>The Read API can be used to read data from BigQuery.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try (BigQueryReadClient BigQueryReadClient = BigQueryReadClient.create()) {
 *   String parent = "";
 *   ReadSession readSession = ReadSession.newBuilder().build();
 *   int maxStreamCount = 0;
 *   ReadSession response = BigQueryReadClient.createReadSession(parent, readSession, maxStreamCount);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the BigQueryReadClient object to clean up resources such
 * as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().
 *
 * <p>The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A "flattened" method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   <li>A "request object" method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   <li>A "callable" method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of BigQueryReadSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * BigQueryReadSettings BigQueryReadSettings =
 *     BigQueryReadSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * BigQueryReadClient BigQueryReadClient =
 *     BigQueryReadClient.create(BigQueryReadSettings);
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * BigQueryReadSettings BigQueryReadSettings =
 *     BigQueryReadSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * BigQueryReadClient BigQueryReadClient =
 *     BigQueryReadClient.create(BigQueryReadSettings);
 * </code>
 * </pre>

   * Creates a new read session. A read session divides the contents of a BigQuery table into one or

   * specifies properties of the data to be read, such as a list of columns or a push-down filter

   *
   * <p>A particular row can be read by at most one stream. When the caller has reached the end of
   * each stream in the session, then all the data in the table has been read.
   *
   * <p>Data is assigned to each stream such that roughly the same number of rows can be read from
   * each stream. Because the server-side unit for assigning data is collections of rows, the API
   * does not guarantee that each stream will return the same number or rows. Additionally, the
   * limits are enforced based on the number of pre-filtered rows, so some filters can lead to
   * lopsided assignments.
   *
   * <p>Read sessions automatically expire 24 hours after they are created and do not require manual
   * clean-up by the caller.
   *
   * <p>Sample code:

   * @param parent Required. The request project that owns the session, in the form of
   *     `projects/{project_id}`.
   * @param readSession Required. Session to be created.
   * @param maxStreamCount Max initial number of streams. If unset or zero, the server will provide
   *     a value of streams so as to produce reasonable throughput. Must be non-negative. The number
   *     of streams may be lower than the requested number, depending on the amount parallelism that
   *     is reasonable for the table. Error will be returned if the max count is greater than the
   *     current system max limit of 1,000.
